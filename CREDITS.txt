We want to correctly attribute all contributions and will maintain this CREDITS.txt file at the head of the trunk.

We discourage including attribution as comments in the code, instead we intend to let the history feature of SVN be the primary method for tracking attributions.

Aparapi Contributors.  Thanks to all.
